Joshua Agbo — Portfolio Specification

Purpose
- Provide a clear, professional specification for Joshua Agbo’s personal portfolio website. Use this document as the source of truth for content, design decisions, assets, and development tasks.

Audience
- Potential employers, collaborators, and clients who want to review Joshua’s skills, projects, resume, and contact details.

Site structure & navigation (header appears on every page)
- Home (index.html)
- Projects (projects.html)
- About / Resume (about.html)
- Contact (contact.html)
- Footer on every page: “© 2025 Joshua Portfolio. All Rights Reserved.”

Design system (visual guidelines)
- Primary color: #0288d1 (accent)
- Background gradient for hero: top pale sky blue #E0F7FA → bottom #ffffff
- Neutral text color: #222. Use a clean sans-serif system stack.
- Spacing: 1rem base unit, containers max-width 1000px.
- Typography: headings bold and clear; body text readable at 16px default.

Responsiveness
- Use Flexbox and CSS Grid. Breakpoints at 900px and 600px.
- Desktop: Projects grid shows 3 columns; tablet 2 columns; mobile 1 column.

Pages and content requirements

1) Home — index.html
- Page title: “Home | JOSHUA”
- Hero (two-column): left column contains name and short introduction; right column shows a professional headshot.
  - H1: Joshua Agbo
  - H2: computer literacy
  - Short bio (2–3 sentences): explain what you do and what visitors can expect. (CONTENT_NEEDED)
  - Primary CTA button: “View My Projects” → projects.html
- Below hero: short welcome / highlights section linking to Projects and About.
- Use `assets/profile.jpg` for the headshot. Provide an accessible alt attribute (e.g., “Joshua Agbo — profile photo”).

2) Projects — projects.html
- Page title: “My Work | JOSHUA”
- Layout: CSS Grid. Card component for each project.
- Project card fields:
  - Image (assets/...), alt text (e.g., “screenshot of [Project Name]”)
  - Title (H3)
  - Short description (1–2 sentences)
  - Tech tags (span.tech-tag)
  - Action: “View” button opens a modal with expanded details.
- Modal behavior: overlay with larger screenshot, full description, role, tech used, links (live site and source repo). Keyboard accessible and closable with Escape and an obvious close button.
- Optional: link to a standalone project detail page when more content is needed.

3) About / Resume — about.html
- Page title: “About | JOSHUA”
- Two-column layout:
  - Left: Education and achievements (school names, years, certificates). CONTENT_NEEDED for exact years and any additional institutions.
  - Right: Skills grouped by category (Web Development: HTML, CSS, Wireframing; Programming: Python; Design: Canva). Add proficiency levels if desired.
- Include a prominent link/button to download the PDF resume: assets/Joshua_Resume.pdf (open in new tab).

4) Contact — contact.html
- Page title: “Contact | JOSHUA”
- Centered contact form (name, email, message). Form action: Formspree endpoint OR mailto fallback. Decide which one to use.
- Visible contact information below the form:
  - Email: agbojoshua506@gmail.com
  - GitHub: github-Joshua (link to full GitHub URL) — CONTENT_NEEDED to provide full GitHub profile URL

Accessibility
- Provide meaningful alt attributes for all images.
- Ensure focus outline is visible for keyboard users.
- Use semantic HTML (nav, main, header, footer, section, article).
- Ensure color contrast meets WCAG AA (modify colors if needed).

Assets (place in /assets)
- profile.jpg — professional headshot (recommended 800×800 px) — REQUIRED
- python-image.jpg or python-placeholder.png — project screenshot
- canva-image.jpg or canva-placeholder.png — project screenshot
- framing-image.jpg or framing-placeholder.png — project screenshot
- Joshua_Resume.pdf — resume PDF (required)

Interactions & behavior
- Navigation links use relative paths and show active state.
- Projects: clicking a card opens the modal; modal should display data attributes from card for title, description, image, tech, and external links.
- Contact form: on success, provide a friendly message or redirect to a thank-you page. If using Formspree, configure the form endpoint.

Development notes
- Keep JavaScript minimal and unobtrusive. Use a single js/main.js for small interactive features (modal, form success UI updates).
- CSS: css/styles.css should contain variables for colors and use Grid/Flexbox for layout.
- Images: compress images for the web and use appropriate file types (JPEG/WEBP for photos, PNG for graphics).

Deployment
- Recommended: push to a GitHub repository and deploy with GitHub Pages or Netlify. Include a README with build & deploy instructions.

How I can help next
- I can update your site now: add your uploaded photo to the homepage and update indexing files.
- I can populate project cards with real content (text + images) if you upload assets and descriptions.
- I can configure the contact form (Formspree or mailto) and implement a client-side success message.

If you want me to proceed: upload your headshot (named profile.jpg) into the assets folder or tell me the filename already there, and I will update the homepage so the photo appears and is optimized for the layout.
